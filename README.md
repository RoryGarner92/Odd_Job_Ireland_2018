# Odd_Job
Final year project - Specification created by Dr. Joseph Kehoe.
Trasfered from the Private working repo hence the lack of commits.
Odd Job was created using the open source Ionic3 Framework'
I also took advantage of some of the things google gives you for free with a Gmail account.
Like : Firebase and all of its components, Google docs and Google Sites.
